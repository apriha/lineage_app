            The <a href="{% url 'index' %}">lineage web app</a> (&ldquo;Web App&rdquo; / &ldquo;service&rdquo;)
            provides an online service that makes available capabilities of the open source
            <a href="https://github.com/apriha/lineage">lineage</a> Python package. The Web App is
            administered by Open Humans Foundation (&ldquo;Open Humans&rdquo;), and the
            service is provided in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;
            without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR

        </p>
        <p>
            These Terms of Use (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) apply to your use of the Web
            App and service. Please read these Terms carefully, since when
            you use the Web App, you agree to be bound by them.
        </p>
        <h3>Content</h3>
        <p>
            You can post content to the Web App, including genetic data,
            and other material you choose.
        </p>
        <p>
            You &mdash; and you alone &mdash; own the rights to the content you create and
            post on the Web App. By publishing it on our site, you give Open Humans
            permission to use your content to do what we reasonably believe is
            necessary to provide our service, including storing, analyzing, displaying,
            reproducing, distributing, and creating derivative works of your content.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are responsible for the information you import to or publish on the Web App
            and assume all risk associated with it, including anyone else&rsquo;s
            reliance on its accuracy or legal claims that might stem from it. By
            posting content on the Web App, you represent that you have the necessary
            rights to publish that material, and that doing so doesn&rsquo;t conflict with
            any licenses you may have granted to others or that others may have granted to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            We donâ€™t pre-screen anyone&rsquo;s content. However, we have the right to
            review and disable access to any content posted on the Web App. We
            aren&rsquo;t responsible for anything that you or anyone else imports to
            or posts on our service.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Web App may contains links to websites, data, and content that we
            don&rsquo;t own or control. We don&rsquo;t endorse or assume responsibility for
            that material, either.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any feedback, comments, or suggestions you send us about the Web App is
            entirely voluntary. We are free to use such feedback, comments, or
            suggestions as we see fit and without any obligation.
        </p>
        <h3>Your Imported Personal Data</h3>
        <p>
            You decide whether you&rsquo;d like to import your personal data into the Web App
            and share it with others. Please understand that if you choose to make your
            personal data available to anyone else, they may decide to use it for other purposes
            with or without your explicit approval. Open Humans isn&rsquo;t responsible
            for enforcing any agreements you might make with others about their use of your data
            or for their data practices.
        </p>
        <h3>Research and Similar Uses</h3>
        <p>
            We must rely on our users to post only data that is accurate and that
            they have the right to post. We do not pre-screen data and do not have
            the ability to independently confirm that any posted data is accurate or
            legal to use. We are not liable for any damages caused to any researcher
            or similar user by reliance on data that proves to be inaccurate or
            otherwise unusable.
        </p>
