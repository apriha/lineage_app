        <h2>Data Use Policy</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href="{% url 'index' %}">lineage web app</a> (&ldquo;Web App&rdquo; / &ldquo;service&rdquo;)
            strives to be a safe and transparent environment for you to manage and analyze your
            personal data, including genetic data from direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies.
        </p>
        <p>
            We want you to know about our practices so that you can make good decisions about
            how you use the Web App. This policy explains what information we collect about
            you, what we do with it, and how you can make choices about sharing it with
            others.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Web App is administered by Open Humans Foundation (&ldquo;Open Humans&rdquo;),
            and the service is provided in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
            WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
        <p>
            Please read this data use policy carefully. It applies to all interactions you have
            with the Web App.
        </p>
        <h3>The Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>
            We collect some personal information from you to create an account that you can use
            to participate in the Web App and to keep you safe and secure on our site.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also collect personal information to make sure the Web App works properly and to
            improve your user experience. This may include using your information for
            analytical purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below is a more detailed explanation of the information we collect and use.
        </p>
        <h4>Information We Collect Directly From You</h4>
        <p>
            When you create an account with the Web App, the Web App receives your Open Humans user
            ID and other information necessary to authenticate with Open Humans. The Web App
            stores this information to help identify you when you log in, make it possible for
            you to manage and change information in your account, and build the service.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unless otherwise allowed via written agreement with Open Humans,
            an account must represent an individual – your personal data, or someone for
            whom you are a legal guardian.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to use the services provided by the Web App, the Web App retrieves and stores
            data
            you have shared with the Web App via Open Humans (e.g., data from
            <a href="https://www.23andme.com/">23andMe</a>,
            <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/">AncestryDNA</a>, or
            <a href="https://www.familytreedna.com/">Family Tree DNA</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, you may upload data to the Web App for analysis. Data uploaded to the Web
            App, and any analyses produced by the Web App, are also stored.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although this information is not publicly available through the Web App, please be
            aware that genetic data in general can be used to learn about your ancestors, and this
            information can be used to identify you. For example, a man&rsquo;s Y chromosome can be
            used to predict his last name (or &ldquo;family name&rdquo;) - this method has been
            used to identify individuals from &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo; genomes. Identifying people
            from genetic data is likely to get easier as genealogy tools become more powerful.
        </p>
        <h4>Information We Automatically Collect</h4>
        <p>
            We receive some information automatically when you visit the website. This includes
            information about the device, browser, and operating system you use when accessing
            our site, your IP address, the website that referred you to the Web App (if any),
            which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make
            to the Web App.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may retain access logs containing this data for up to 60 days and then delete them.
        </p>
        <h4>Cookie Policy</h4>
        <p>
            Cookies are small data files placed on your computer by websites you visit in order
            to help them remember certain information about you.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you log in to your account, the Web App will place a cookie for the purposes
            of creating the session, knowing when you&rsquo;re logged in, and validating form
            submissions. The cookie contains an encrypted user identifier.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most browsers include an option to clear existing cookies or reject new ones.
            However, if you reject new cookies, portions of the Web App will not function as
            intended.
        </p>
        <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
        <p>
            We may use your personal information when needed to keep the site running,
            prevent abuse, and improve the Web App. Your information is used internally
            only where necessary to provide our services.
        </p>
        <h3>How We Disclose Your Information</h3>
        <p>
            Once you’ve created an account, you may import data from a variety of sources, such as
            direct-to-consumer DNA testing companies.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a connected Open Humans account, the Web App will upload the results of initial
            analyses to the user&rsquo;s Open Humans account.
        </p>
        <p>
            Open Humans will share your non-public personal data with others only under
            these circumstances:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                with your consent, and after letting you know what information will be shared and
                with whom, unless otherwise permitted in this policy.
            </li>
            <li>
                if we believe it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or
                valid legal process. If we are going to release your information, our policy is
                to provide you with notice unless we are prohibited from doing so by law or court
                order (e.g., an order under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 2705(b)). However, we may disclose
                your information without providing you with prior notice if we believe
                it&rsquo;s necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person.
            </li>
            <li>
                to third parties helping us offer and improve our service, such as those
                providing Web App technical tools and analytics services that help us
                understand how people use our service.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We may also share aggregate information with others &ndash; for instance, with our
            funders, to help them understand our community and how it uses our service.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the Web App or Open Humans is involved in a reorganization, merger,
            acquisition or sale of our assets, your personal information may be transferred to
            another entity as part of that deal. If that happens, we will notify you and let
            you know what your options are.
        </p>
        <h3>Account Disabling</h3>
        <p>
            You may delete your Web App account at any time. This means that data imported from
            your Open Humans account, data uploaded by you to the Web App, and data generated
            through your use of the Web App will also be deleted. However, Cookies may not be
            deleted, and data automatically collected will not be deleted and will be handled
            per &ldquo;Information We Automatically Collect&rdquo;, detailed above.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data uploaded to your Open Humans account will not be deleted, unless you request it
            to be deleted via Open Humans.
        </p>
        <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
        <p>
            We may revise this Data Use Policy from time to time. The most current version of
            the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be available
            <a href="{% url 'data-use-policy' %}">online</a>. If we make changes that
            we believe will substantially alter your rights, we will e-mail you and prominently
            display a notice on our site 7 days before we make those changes.
        </p>
        <h3>Contact</h3>
